        <p class="header">Climate change has always been one of the most discussed topics around the world. Some people think it has little impact on out daily life, some others believe that it will be the reason for human extinction, while a few of us do not believe in it at all.
            <br>However, data dose not lie.
            <br>In this visualisation, we will try to explore how climate has changed worldwide, and how much it has influence our planet </p>

        <p class="text" id = "t1">
            When it comes to climate change, greenhouse gas is always to be blamed. Among all the greenhouse gasses, <span class="carbon"><strong>Carbon Dioxide</strong></span> seems to make a major part of them.
            <br><br>
            Chart at left shows our average annual CO2 emission as parts per million. As we can see,
            in 2021 we have reached almost <span class="carbon"><strong>420ppm</strong></span>. That was roughly <span class="carbon"><strong>50ppm</strong></span> more CO2 than 20 years ago (about 370ppm at year 2000).
            Before 2000, it took us about 30 years to see 50ppm increase from 1971 to 2001. This shows that we are producing CO2 at much higher rate each year!

            It is known that <span class="temp"><strong>Earth Surface Temperature</strong></span> is related to CO2 emission. However, the question is how strong is the correlation?
            <br><br>
            Chart at left shows the global average annual temperature change from 1880 to 2020. We can see that in 1940 there's the first positive change in global average temperature of 0.13°C.
            In 2020, the rate of change has rocketed to <span class="temp"><strong>1.02°C</strong></span>. That is about <span class="temp"><strong>150%</strong></span> increase than 20 years ago!

        <p class="text" id = "t4">
            It is obvious now that our planet is getting hotter and hotter every year, but how is rising temperature affecting our habitat?
            One consequence is that <span class="sea"><strong>Sea Level</strong></span> is also rising. This is not difficult to understand, as ice sheets in North Pole are melting.
            <br><br>
            Chart at right illustrates rise in sea level every year. As we can see, sea level started to rise in 2001 by about 4mm, and now in 2021 sea level has raised by about <span class="sea"><strong>70mm</strong></span>. That is <span class="sea"><strong>17.5</strong></span> times more just over 20 years!
